### Project Description
[THE WEBSITE MAKES RCIPES ACCORDING TO THE USER'S WISH.This project is a Recipe Sharing Web Application designed with a clean, intuitive user interface for users to submit, view, and explore various recipes. The project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive, responsive experience that feels both modern and user-friendly. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the project:

HTML Structure:

The HTML provides the foundational structure for the recipe-sharing form, where users can enter recipe details like title, ingredients, and instructions. A section is also dedicated to displaying saved recipes, making it easy for users to review submitted entries.
JavaScript Functionality:

JavaScript powers the interactivity of the application. When users submit their recipe, the data is processed by JavaScript and dynamically added to the recipe list. Each entry is displayed within the page without needing to reload, enhancing user experience and engagement.
JavaScript also includes data validation to ensure that required fields are filled out, improving the quality of the information submitted.
CSS Styling:

The CSS provides a clean and engaging aesthetic. The header is styled with a bright blue background to draw attention, while the form itself is given a white card-like appearance with rounded edges and shadowing for depth. Buttons are interactive, with hover effects to guide users, and the recipe list is formatted with soft background colors for easy readability.
Project Highlights:
User-Centered Design: With a minimalistic form layout, users can submit recipes quickly and view them immediately.
Real-Time Interactivity: Recipes are added to the list without page reloads, thanks to JavaScript.
Clear and Consistent Visual Theme: The color scheme and layout are designed to keep users focused on content, ensuring a pleasant browsing experience.
This project is an ideal starting point for anyone interested in building interactive web applications that require data entry, storage, and real-time display on¬†a¬†single¬†page]

![Workflow](https://github.com/Joice-2004/Personalised_recipe_generator/blob/main/dia.png)
The workflow of the recipe generator website begins with the user accessing the site through a web browser, where they are presented with a user-friendly interface designed using HTML and styled with CSS. The user inputs a list of ingredients into a designated field and selects their dietary preferences, such as Paleo, Vegan, Vegetarian, or Gluten-Free. Upon submission, this data is processed by JavaScript, which is responsible for handling the logic behind the scenes. The JavaScript checks against a collection of hardcoded recipes embedded within the script to identify matches that align with the user's specified ingredients and dietary restrictions. Once the processing is complete, the website dynamically updates to display a selection of relevant recipes, including names, ingredients, and preparation instructions. Users can then review these recipes, and if they wish to refine their search, they can modify their input or preferences, effectively restarting the workflow.
